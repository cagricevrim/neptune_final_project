# Neptune Computational Biology - Final Project

# DropSeq Data Analysis

## Introduction and Goals

The goal of my project is to sort out and make some meaning out of DropSeq Single Cell Sequencing Data.
DropSeq generates RNAseq reads from a lot of cells in a way that each cell has a sequence barcode and reads of every cells is starting with this unique barcode. This project is focusing on to generate a workflow to sort reads with the same barcode together and generate individual cell transcriptome libraries. 

I'll use Python to sort the sequence reads and generate libraries for individual cell transcriptomes.

I will use the original DropSeq data generated presented in Macosko et al. 2015 (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE63473)
