# Neptune Computational Biology - Final Project

# DropSeq Data Analysis

## Introduction and Goal

The goal of my project is to sort out and make some meaning out of DropSeq Single Cell Sequencing Data.
DropSeq generates RNAseq reads from a lot of cells in a way that each cell has a sequence barcode and reads of every cells is starting with this unique barcode. This project is focusing on to generate a workflow that generate simulation of DropSeq reads.

I'll use Python to make a function that simulates DropSeq data. I'll generate a function (seqsim.py) that'd generate 100 different barcodes and 10000 reads each carrying one of those barcodes.
