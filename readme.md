# Neptune Computational Biology - Final Project

## Guidelines - you can delete this section before submission

This repository is a stub for your final project. Fork it, develop your project, and submit it as a pull request. Edit/ delete the text in this readme as needed.

Some guidelines and tips:

- Use the stubs below to write up your final project.

- For information on formatting text files with markdown, see https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/ . You can use markdown to include images in this document by linking to files in the repository, eg `![Figure 1](./Figure1.png?raw=true)`.

- The project must be entirely reproducible. In addition to the results, the repository must include all the data (or links to data) and code needed to reproduce the results.

- If you are working with unpublished data that you would prefer not to publicly share at this time, please contact me to discuss options. In most cases, the data can be anonymized in a way that putting them in a public repo does not compromise your other goals.

- Paste references (including urls) into the reference section, and cite them with the general format (Smith at al. 2003).

- Commit and push often as you work.

OK, here we go.

# DropSeq Data Analysis

## Introduction and Goals

The goal of my project is to sort out and make some meaning out of DropSeq Single Cell Sequencing Data.
DropSeq generates RNAseq reads from a lot of cells in a way that each cell has a sequence barcode and reads of every cells is starting with this unique barcode. This project is focusing on to generate a workflow to sort reads with the same barcode together and generate individual cell transcriptome libraries. 

I'll use Python to sort the sequence reads and generate libraries for individual cell transcriptomes.

I will use the original DropSeq data generated presented in Macosco et al. 2015 (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE63473)
